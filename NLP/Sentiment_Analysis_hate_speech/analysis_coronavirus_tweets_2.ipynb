I am not surprised. Ok so I just heard a news where a boy was badly beaten by sum Italians because they thought he was Chinese, and therefore he had the coronavirus. The situation here is getting out of hand,   And as a Filipina this shit made me wanna leave this fckn racist country asap. Coronavirus is a new pestilence of modern era.I\\'m just curious if it was not Chinese but let\\'s say Swiss or Italians or any other European nation, would it be the same effect of isolation? Is China the most intolerant nation of nowadays or is it just a chain of events & numbers? #Coronavirus apparently confirmed in Rome.

By Wednesday there were 400, almost all in the richest part of the country. Fill your shopping cart with enough food and meds for 30 days. Suggest Italians to \"close borders\" at street level (e.g. ~100 households).   Your gov doesn\\'t close border at country level. You do it at street area level.  Closely monitor any suspicious guys, say, Chinese. It is not discrimination. It is your health. #coronavirus Realising if this was 2021, UK Gov may consider issuing special guidance for Italians (as they have for Chinese citizens) if they arrived after 31 Dec and were stuck in the UK for an extended period of time due to an issue like Coronavirus... Brexit realities hitting hard! Don\\'t blame the Italians.  Even I am living in Hong Kong, the #coronavirus disclosure is not transparent. The actual situation is hidden by China and @WHO. They are working seamlessly to conceal the fact. Seems like the Coronavirus is very fond of Italians. The reason why there are so many cases of Coronavirus here in Italy is because we are actively trying to look for them.  The problem irises when the government isn\\'t prepared to an outbreak of the virus.  Italians are being checked in italians airports before a flight but - Coronavirus, many countries do not recommend travel to Italy and impose arrival restrictions on Italians, while Italy continues to import all without limits.

I feel the urge to write about how Italians are reacting to the Coronavirus outbreak.  Have a nice day! Time to control the boarders with Slovenians. The corona virus is heading this way!! Too many Italians, Austrians, Germans and Slovenians coming in everyday? Any plan of action?  Start now! @VladaRH When are you lot gonna introduce the corona virus boarder control on the boarders with Slovenia since there are too many Italians, Austrians and  Slovenians coming in everyday?? After the shit hit the fan? Coronavirus really went after those racist Italians  TMW when it takes a corona virus outbreak for Italians to start remote working for real #smartworking #backtothefuture At the beginning of last week over 16,000 Americans had died of the flu this year and nobody batted an eye...but a few Italians and Koreans contract Coronavirus over the weekend and everything crashes. Wonderful First Wuhan now Italian police are preventing 50,000 Italians entering or leaving towns gripped by the coronavirus in Lombardy, Italy. If the crisis gets worse the military have been authorised to move in. \\xa0 Soo over 200 people in Italy have come down with coronavirus and 5 (I think) Italians have passed away. EU and the world health organization are combining efforts to combat the spread, idk but I think there’s something the WHO isn’t telling us  Bio-weapon’s Pandemic Massacres out of China: 8 dead in Iran, 5 in Italy: 219 Italians infected, guinea-pigs for FiveEyes’ vaccine?  #coronaviruslombardia #coronavirus \\xa0 Coronavirus has spread to Italy. A few cases last week several hundred as of today. A handful of Italians dead. Scientists still do not know how it\\'s spreading so rapidly.   @realDonaldTrump visits Taj Mahal.. Bravo to the Italians for confirming local person to person spread of COVID-19! If it\\'s happening in the UK, we\\'d never know as you need to fit the rigid PHE case definition (which still doesn\\'t mention N Italy) to be tested.#covid_19 #coronavirus Everyone knows that Italy has been the country most affected by #coronavirus #Covid_19 because Italians light kiss each other at every hello and goodbye  #Italy and #coronavirus: Italians traveling abroad were already feeling the effects of a crackdown, with a bus from Milan barricaded by police in the French city of Lyon for health checks and an arriving Alitalia plane blocked on the tarmac in....Mauritius \\xa0 Of course the Italians fuck up the corona virus man those guys cant do anything right Its not just us Italians are panic buying now due to coronavirus. Number of UK cases of coronavirus is now 13. How can we allow our rugby team and supporters return? Some of our players looked afflicted on the pitch and in the next two weeks the Italians will be invading our shores. What’s the Shinners policy on Bubonic plague et Nobody beats the Italians in protecting themselves from the #coronavirus. Always in sty So what\\'s happening with the IRLvITA game @IrishRugby ?  This #coronavirus has people worried.  The influx, albeit small enough, of Italians is a bit dodgy. No?

Perhaps that’s what the Italians have as a solution against Coronavirus in Rome. Maybe that’s what my mother meant. That their antibiotics at that particular hospital in Rome cured two Chinese tourists. If you’re using the coronavirus to be racist towards Italians and Asian people, then you’re suffering from a severe case of ignorance. We should be helping one another to fight the virus, not spreading hate. #Therealdangerisignorance keep that same energy for italians too if you’re so concerned about the danger of the situation. what’s that? you’re not going to? sounds like it’s racist situation that is masked by the coronavirus \\xa0 LOL thanks @nickccorbett Italians, at the end of their coronavirus world, will still refuse to buy pen i probably shouldn\\'t say this but it\\'s really funny to me that the same italians who told immigrants who fled from war to go back to their countries are the same who are now trying to leave bc of coronavirus... oh how the tables have turned Italians returning to London are disturbed by the absence of coronavirus checks at London\\'s airports. \\xa0 1917 characters as Italians during Great Coronavirus’ War: \\xa0 someone: what’s coronavirus doing to ppl?   italians: \\xa0 Italians struggle amid coronavirus quarantine \\xa0 via @YouTube Don\\'t worry the Italians have the Coronavirus on their main agenda.

Why? We never did this to Saudis on MERS or Americans on swine flu. Coronavirus is the end of EU. Italians are freeing to the other EU countries I was talking to a professor on the Coronavirus. He thought the Coronavirus would be contained, until it appeared in Italy. The Italians cannot find the source of the infection! If it took hold in the U.K. and two thirds got infected 700000 would die.its now 50/50 in his opinion We’d like reassuring all our past, future guests and business partners that both of us, together with all the other 884.640 Umbrians and the 60,000,000 Italians are alive ‘n’ kicking \\xa0 #coronavirus #italy #news Italians fighting against corona viru God damn, how lucky, you BARELY escaped getting infected with the coronavirus by the 4 Italians that came to Tenerife, Canary Islands, on February 17th, 2020.

Here is a prime example of that: a man tackling in style the #CoronavirusOutbreak in #Italy #Naples #COVIDー19 #coronavir Some say that Italians are fascinated with the economy under #China\\'s rule.

On arrival back in London...nothing. No wonder the Italians are detecting more cases of the coronavirus  1/2  Italy is a first europeon country who has been badly effected by corona virus. Italian govt appeared in different TV shows and asked italians to stay calm as his govt will do best to protect them with the help and advise of PROTEZIONE CIVILE.....  They cordon off efdected Oh dear, the Italian Dr was with family. A group of 10.  Remember my big table last week?  10 Italians  @JaniceMod4  Should Coronavirus Stop Us Travelling Around Europe? \\xa0 Because Italians people tested too much and found the Coronavirus infected... others country didn’t do this ! But Coronavirus is everywhere! In the 1990s we were escaping from the Balkans to take refuge in Italy, now we escape from Italy to the Balkans  Northern Italians are now unwelcome in Southern Italy, rather than vice-versa  So far, coronavirus is showing a considerable sense of irony! To the thousands of Italians who have responded: we are working overtime to get you the medically recommended dose porn. Please stay indoors! The doctor will see you soon! #Coronavirus #Veneto #Lombardia #ItalyisforLovers\\xa0 The European Parliament has suspended the start of the “stage” for the Italians trainees coming from the North Regions because of the Coronavirus.   Is it a decision taken by @EP_President or by the Secreraty General Klaus Wel Is guessing and looking for patterns now racist? Jesus, if you have nothing to say but race-baiting crap, just shut up.

Italians don’t know the value of white sliced pan in times of crisis and I pity them for it. FUCKING ITALIANS THEY BROUGHT THE F CORONAVIRUS TO ARGENTINA I feel bad about non italians who are missing the great coronavirus memes Italy is not spreading anything anywhere. Coronavirus is already in all Europe and you don\\'t even know. We don\\'t have borders with China, we don\\'t have direct flights to and from China from January, and you think it\\'s only Italians who have the virus? Very funny... Yes, they are very expensive and now for Italians it’s not so easy to go abroad...because of corona virus we should  self isolation for 14 days  Tricky to see how England v Italy goes ahead in Rome in March 14 after Ireland cal off their game against Italians over Coronavirus fears ZSchneeweiss: Salvini demands $11 billion aid for Italians hit by the coronavirus lockdown  via @JohnFollain - \\xa0 Everyone knows Italy unleashed the Coronavirus to tip the nomination to Amy Klobuchar.

This evening 3,000 Italians are expected at a soccer match in Lyon. How many of them are already infected?  #coronavirus #COVID19 #Lyon\\xa0 Donkey Italians are the most racist people in the world.

More like carbonaravirus. #f1inbox do you think that the corona virus will influence the f1 races at the start of the season? There are rumours that the state Viktoria do not want the F1 people to enter. Vietnam doesnt allow italians to enter the country.  I would like to hear your opinion on this. Italians during Coronavirus Outbreak \\xa0 There\\'s a lot of misinformation around tbh, all Europe (Globe?) has Coronavirus, Italians are just overdramatic about it  At the same time we\\'re the safest country: we\\'re locking entire regions just as a precautionary measure in order to prevent the potential spread Italians are going nuts.  A Filipino-Italian man has been beaten in a store because the aggressor thought he was a Chinese guy, infected by the Coronavirus. As if all the Asian guys are infected. Or as if beaten them solve the problems.  I feel ashamed. \\xa0 this corona virus are making italians even more racist I AM SO MAD !!!! NATURAL SELECTION IS COMIN FKR YALL The sad story of \"penne lisce\" in the time of Coronavirus, remaining on the supermarkets shelves despite the ravages.   And some hope that after the emergency italians will be a bit less racists towards foreigners and pasta types... #penneli If #IREvITA is cancelled out of fear that travelling Italians could bring the Coronavirus with them and spread it to other people at the match. How does it make sense to allow them to travel and visit bars, restaurants and tourist attractions instead? None of this makes sense. @IrishRugby @Federugby @SixNationsRugby given the hypocrisy & stupidity regarding #IREvITA game displayed by Irish Federation & @SimonHarrisTD & some Irish people reaction that are more dangerous to Italians than #coronavirus, have you planned the refund of tickets for the game? 12 Italians have now died with 374 infected. Italian experts say #coronavirus will take several months to pass, but that infected people are getting better. @CBCAle Number of people struck down with #coronavirus at quarantined #Tenerife hotel DOUBLES to four overnight: Two more #Italians are diagnosed as #British families are told they face two weeks in #lockdown \\xa0 via @MailOnline How italians are reacting to the coronavirus threat,on released interviews:  Venetians: \"we are alchol,that will protect us\"  Tuscans: \"I don\\'t give a shit\"  Baresi: \"I haven\\'t brought anything,masks nor anything else,i want to die\"  I love my country funny how because of the coronavirus italians suddenly know how to clean their house and become all hygienic  \"Everything is very quiet,\" says Briton Christopher Betts, one of more than 700 guests spending a second day in lockdown at a four-star Tenerife hotel on Wednesday after four cases of coronavirus were detected there among a group of Italians.

Even here in Italy, other countries, call us \"Infected\", even some Italians themselves call us “Corona Virus\" if you come from Lombardy or Veneto. I wish all this hatred would stop. For everyone. Asians, Italians, everyone. \\xa0 No work today because of Coronavirus and italians acting like there\\'s a zombie apocalypse, guess we going preordering Animal Crossing I did not skip the Italians, I just forgot that they are also Coronavirus hotspot. They should also be refused entry into Africa. I know. I didn’t insult any Italians. In fact I was complaining about sth else: That Corona Virus can be anywhere and also people would panic wherever the virus is; Whether it’s in Italy, Iran or ... the italians are TRIPPIN over the #coronavirus here looool chill Italians buy Pasta and food due coronavirus You know what? This whole psychotic non sense shit about coronavirus will also kill our tourism in 2020. And again..the virus is already in the other countries who treat Italians like plague carriers. Fuck this. Since italians have some corona virus porblems they bought the stores empty to hoard food but I love how they\\'d rather starve than eat full grain farfalle from Baril #Coronavirus cases rise in #Italy, with children among new cases  Italians or people who had recently visited the north of the country have tested positive in Spain, Austria, Switzerland, Croatia and France since the WE, showing how far and fast...  \\xa0 But they, the #Italians, just celebrated #OrangeBattle festival of 3 days from 22nd to 25th even while the #CoronaVirus was reported in #Italy & several towns locked down.

Italians are getting fricking crazy #COVIDー19 #coronavirus Guys, the numbers on Italy are also nonsense. Looking around Europe, it seems like Italians are transmitting the virus across Europe very quickly!

You must know a few Italians who could pop over  if you have a look in our cities, you will be able to see hundres of africans pusher selling heroins and drugs to italians teens. Our economy is not so strong due to our high debit; no other european countries help us neither in this emercency @coronavirus Two more people have tested positive for coronavirus in Tenerife, raising the total to four. They are part of the same group of Italians who arrived to the island on the 17th February from Lombardy  Samples obtained from these two will be sent to the Carlos III Health Institute I think those foreigners tested positive for coronavirus in Africa were purposely send to Africa to spread the virus. And before they left their countries (mostly the Italians) didn\\'t they test them for the virus before allowing them going out?  #COVID19 Our general approach to avoiding corona: don\\'t make out with any Italians. #realtalk #france #coronavirus Coronavirus             Your mom                                       Spreads for Italians I swear Italians are  travelling to every country infecting people with the coronavirus \\xa0 Guess what? Not all Italians have #CoronaVirus .  Stop blaming or excluding us, you idiots Italians spreading coronavirus all over the place like it\\'s the middle ages and they\\'re trying to spread the plague, for fucks sake FAKE OR TRUE? Coronavirus outbreak all over in USA, spurs \"SANITA\\'\" warning for ITALIANS not to travel to FLORIDA, NY, TEXAS, CALIFORNIA, W DC., SOUTH CAROLINA. You should look around your own country mate, you can\\'t even enter the North now. In one day alone there is a 50% rise in new #coronavirus cases alone. Of course Italians need to be banned from entering the US. Complete BAN until officials can figure out what the hell is going on Only those coming to Doha from Egypt. Egyptians living anywhere else where corona virus is not spread can enter. This applies to Italians and Koreans not only Egyptians. Gonna start being racist to Italians irl.  any time I hear someone say “mama Mia that’s a hot meatball” or whatever I’m going to cover my mouth and ask if they have corona virus See if that Coronavirus gets bad enough, does our league get postponed? Or cancelled this season? Italians already postponing games for it. Wouldn’t be surprised to see football in Europe called off for a few months to mop it up. how come yall was openly racist to chinese people after the coronavirus but, yall got nothing to say about italians huh? inch resti I completely understand you point but stuff like this happens everywhere, not only here. My friend told me that Italians tried not to interact with Asians in any way and looked at them differently since the coronavirus spread. Bad and racism exist all over the world. \\xa0 Italians are the official corona virus dispatchers. WTH \\xa0 Surprised the Italians allowed her   - perhaps the scientists want to see how the Corona virus works within a fat mouth hypocritical bitch It should, biosecurity is paramount. There own citizens who went to Italy have already multiplied the #Coronavirus within there own borders. BAN THE ITALIANS. Safest bet there is. The State Department will do it too but likely next week after several thousand more Italians infect people in the past after me telling them that I am Italian: ohhh pizza people now when I say that I am Italian: oh, many Italians have coronavirus, right??? BBC News - Coronavirus: Chinese targeted as Italians panic \\xa0 #coronavirus A WARNING TO ALL THE PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF ITALY!

A dark shadow over @F1’s 2020 opener in Melbourne, with the first @MotoGP in Qatar halted by #Coronavirus travel restrictions on Italians.  @Ferrari, sure, but no #f1 cars roll without #Pirelli. The tyres are made in Turkey, but the techs are based in Milan. @petrolhedonist Italians are not contented people, how can you go to China and the only thing you can take from there is Coronavirus? Why?  So glad I got to experience Italy. Wanted to go back. Gonna have to wait a while now. Wishing Italians the best. #Coronavir Doubt that these homeless are Asians or Italians  so no concern wrt coronavirus outbreak. Italians are distributing Coronavirus to all these countries at a crazy rate.  Most of the new cases in all the new countries are from Italians just arriving from Italy.  Trump’s task force is filled with many who have no clue of disease prevention. Ban travel from Italy now Turkmenistan has forbidden entrances of Italians  due to #coronavirus . Where the fuck is #turkmenistan ?

Italy and Italians are fabulous so am devastated for what all of this will cost them.  Will rebook for the summer  I told a friend that the Italian guy was on a mission.   They have tried it in Egypt and Ivory Coast but failed.   They already have the antidotes, so they need enough market for it.   Did you ask why Italians were the ones that carried the coronavirus to about 13 countries? @TOPublicHealth why is your coronavirus website info only targetting Asians now. That\\'s so racist.  Italians and Iranians are as big or bigger risk. They\\'ll be ok. But they can use Italy as an excuse. I have a friend who is now at home bc he had contact with me. But It\\'s not that Italians get coronavirus more than others, it\\'s only that we are super testing and others are testing people who had been in Italy as criteria. When you keep allowing Italians or people who have traveled to Italy recently in the last 14 days into the country without a quarantine order or ban, the #coronavirus plague spreads. It bemuses me what this administration is afraid of, just ban South Korea and Italy for now. \\xa0 Italy banned flights to China on 31st Jan British Airways 21st Feb Italy has large number of cases of coronavirus cases Italians travelled to and from China via third party countries so they lost control of where people had been and couldnt trace Labour - close airports  Duh ? ppl being racist af to chinese ppl because of coronavirus while italians are the ones spreading it, i hate white ppl Corona Virus: the entry of Italians and Japanese at risk in Qatar: \\xa0Irta warned teams and participants at the GP of Losail of the two nationalities to leave for Qatar as soon as possible to avoid possible changes in the access arrangements in Qatar \\xa0 Christian Ronaldo, Juventus players in #coronavirus scare  self quarantine or go to hosp, sensible approach \\xa0 Italians trapped in mass quar chaos in cities in N Italy should sue Fontana, ISS, Conte over unnecess hardship, chaos, supported self isolat is best How many Italians visiting globally at anyone time...any Italians on moon yet? #coronavirus Trump administration wanting to close the Mexican border due to coronavirus is nothing more than Trump\\'s racist agenda showing it\\'s ugly head. Italians, Iranians and Chinese folks are not trying to gain access to US illegally through Mexico to infect us. Come on people. \\xa0 saying there is no travel between these countries or internally. It\\'s simply that there is considerably less only a moron would suggest there is some equivalency...  To date,  the three coronavirus Infections detected in Africa came from Italians traveling to Nigeria.  Are the not to be shitty because i love my country but i\\'m laughing because before spreading here, corona virus was associated with asian people and italians were afraid to just be in the presence of them. now other countries are afraid to be near us DJNDJNDJ I don\\'t usually agree w Russia,but taking extreme measures to decrease spread of #Coronavirus is needed,unlike UK which allowed Italians to waltz in through Heathrow without checks. UK should bar all Italians entry until Italy brings outbreak under control \\xa0 In no way am I defending him since I\\'m was raised Jewish, but why didn\\'t you tweet your displeasure of Trump banning Iranians because of coronavirus but not banning South Koreans or Italians? Why is Iran worse than those two countries during this crisis? Amidst the coronavirus panic in Milan, Italians rush to avoid Pennette Lisce more than the virus itself.

Flights  and italians need suspension. @Ma3Route\\xa0 Just ordered a pizza, those damn Italians better not give me coronavirus.  So the acting Irish government make a very hasty announcement in calling off the rugby, but dublin airport is instructed not to screen passengers. Italians are still coming to dublin this week. The hysteria around this corona virus is unreal. Italians now dispatch riders for Corona virus? \\xa0 the way the Italians are spreading the coronavirus you’d think it started from their country Im not in a panic mode like most italians. Schools and universites closed for the second week in a row in nothern Italy. An italian scientific study concludes that coronavirus is around since October. The Us will have bigger numbers in no time. tw/ corona virus (covid-19) apparently italians like to travel a l Corona virus has really got the Italians on the rop The Italians seem all to be working for \"Coronavirus logistics Co.

Italians stay indoors as country records over 1000 Coronavirus cases, 29 deaths – Punch Newspapers \\xa0 Do you really think that the virus is spread by Italians? did you know that in Italy everyone is treated, nobody is left behind and tests are done? did you know that in the US people die on the streets and a test costs thousands of dollars? #coronavirus #coronavirusus Here’s a first: the entire high-speed train car to myself. Italians aren’t taking any chances with #coronavirus #covid19 #italy #trenitalia #corona #coronavirusitalla #Coronavi Coronavirus hits the last bastion of Christendom and migrants hit the Christendom of Greece . Hmm some might think this is planned .  They close the borders to the Christian Italians and open the borders for the Muslims But hey, I\\'m sure soon we\\'ll be having cases in Latin America and we are starting to have cases unfortunately. And also keep in mind that Chinese are not the only ones who might be transporting coronavirus. Italians and other nationalities are now transporting it The virus does not choose based on nationality! Come on expect something better, @christufton, this move is stupid and even racist.  Italians passengers barred from leaving cruise ship in Jamaica over coronavirus concerns - Stabroek News \\xa0 @Italians4Trump, @italianpress Good Humor, now you need to try Italian beers. 5,000 Italians per day coming into USA with no screening.  Thanks for the coronavirus gift per the Italian Government.

The Italians are spreading it like the plague. And neither have Italians been banned from entering Australia. There can only be one reason to ban Iranians only - they’re Muslim, not Catholic. South Koreans are also “acceptable” because they’re mostly non-religious. Thing is, they are all capable of carrying Coronavirus. \\xa0 Study: Corona Virus is more likely to affect lighter skinned individuals Italians: THANK GOD IM NOT WHITE   Prato’s Chinese community fears coronavirus infection — by Italians \\xa0 Empty supermarket shelves and the spread of designer face masks show that Italians are panicking about coronavirus. The spread of the virus demands a planned and coherent response — but the politics of fear are instead turning Italians against each other. \\xa0 He probably should have banned Italians too. By the way, not only is he a climate denier,he is a “corona virus” denier too.He keeps saying that it’s no big deal,and it will “miraculously go away in April”. Our virus numbers are low,simply because we haven’t been testing for it. Italians saying “boh” to corona virus. No official line re: reports two Italians initially diagnosed with #coronavirus were false positives. I’m told there were two - three riders in the teams’ hotel who tested positive o/night and ambos were seen outside the hotel. Riders with confirmed negatives I believe have left. so we use the corona virus as an excuse to be racists towards asians? and then somehow decide to use it to continue being racists towards mexicans? but lets let all the italians and european right in, right!? white people cant carry this disease, right!? \\xa0 Milan, Italians stay indoors as country records over 1000 Coronavirus cases, 29 deaths  \\xa0 Given the impact of coronavirus in Italy, your comments about hot-blooded Italians seems inappropriate.

Because you didn\\'t see italians. I still remember when an italian guy went back from china, and rather than go to an hospital to check himself if he was positive to coronavirus, he went to a bar with his friend. Or when another escaped the quarantine to see his family. It seems far impossible to ban Italian people on kissing. You know who, Italians !  Coronavirus sucks Idk how poc do it tbh.

I appreciate PM’s efforts against #coronavirus, but still Italians or Iranians can fly to . Melanie Phillips on Politics Live boasting of \\'Keep Calm and Carry On\\' Britishness ()... and bemoaning our failure to cut transport to those disease-spreading Italians.   Talking Heads like her are a greater threat to civilisation than Coronavirus. Dear Turkmenistan, Nauru, Angola etc. We italians hardly know where you are on the map.

Something is going on here #coronavirus #Italy #italians Do NOT come to Denmark on your holiday. Do not travel. People are dying and 50 northern Italians just went out on holiday in Copenhagen. Think of the people you are putting at risk. You could be responsible for actual deaths.

Majority of Italians Say Leftist Govt Has Not Done Enough to Prevent Coronavirus Outbreak | Breitbart \\xa0 #coronavirus #COVID19 Opinion: It’s absolutely disgraceful thousands of Italians are allowed fly into Dublin this weekend possibly widely spreading Coronavirus \\xa0 via @theliberal_ie as an italian, seeing some people from the usa posting things like: \"they should cancel italians too then\" in tweets about the coronavirus....it\\'s....yeah..(adding that.....yeah even in europe itself a lot of countries don\\'t want italians in their territory....) Close to 200 Italians have died because of Corona virus... What do you expect? Roughly 2.4 billion people live in East and south East Asia, to stereotype them all as carriers of coronavirus because it started in one province of china while not similarly stereotyping Iranians and Italians is not even remotely justifiable don\\'t sugarcoat it.
